# GDS Autotask MCP — Fork Changelog

This file records the GDS-specific divergence of this fork from upstream
(`WYRE-AI/autotask-mcp`). It is maintained by hand (the automated `CHANGELOG.md`
is managed by semantic-release) so the "what shipped and why" survives
independently of GitHub PR pages — e.g. after leaving the fork network.

Each entry lists the merge commit and the PR number. Brief section references
(§x.y) point at the GDS Autotask MCP Fork Implementation Brief.

## Unreleased — Phase 2 P0 repair & foundation

Completes the P0 "Repair & Foundation" block of the Phase 2 Development &
Testing punch list (2026-09-16) — items 1-5 (the reported defects and the
contract tests around them) and items 6-8 (the write foundation).

Two defects were reported; both turned out to be instances of wider classes, and
two of the three remaining items turned out to be partly built already. The audit
is what this entry mostly records. Field names and mutability below were read from
this tenant's live `entityInformation/fields`, not assumed.

### Safe orchestration — MCP-CORE-004 / MCP-CORE-005
- `dryRun` existed on exactly one tool (`create_maintenance_ticket`), written inline.
  Extracted to `utils/write-plan.ts` as the shared envelope every orchestrating
  write now returns: `{ status, validation, ... }` where status is
  `validation_failed` | `duplicate` | `dry_run` | a tool-specific success label,
  and anything but the success label means **nothing was written**. `validation`
  is the ordered trail of every precondition checked, including the ones that
  passed — that is what makes a dry run reviewable. The orchestrator was
  refactored onto it with its 16 existing tests unchanged, which is the evidence
  the abstraction did not bend its contract.
- Read-after-write coverage extended: `create_configuration_item` is registered
  in `CREATE_TOOL_META` with `verifyRead`, and `link_project_commercial` confirms
  field-by-field that the write actually landed.

### Configuration item lifecycle writes — MCP-CI-001
- CI reads (search, entitlement, coverage gaps) were strong; there were **no CI
  write tools**. Adds `autotask_create_configuration_item` and
  `autotask_update_configuration_item`.
- The service had `createConfigurationItem`/`updateConfigurationItem` already, but
  they were unguarded passthroughs over the top-level `POST /ConfigurationItems`
  route with **no callers anywhere** — dead code. Replaced.
- Live schema (`ConfigurationItems/entityInformation/fields`) drove the design:
  `companyID` is REQUIRED but READ-ONLY, so creation goes through the
  `Companies/{id}/ConfigurationItems` child route (§4.2 precedent) and a CI can
  **never be moved between companies** — the update path refuses it with that
  explanation. There is no lifecycle/status picklist on the entity either, so
  retire is `isActive: false`.
- Writes are filtered to the 33 fields Autotask actually accepts; the read-only
  `rmm*`/`ssl*` audit surface it populates from the RMM integration is dropped
  with a warning instead of failing the write.
- Guards Autotask does not enforce: a referenced contract or parent CI must
  belong to the same company as the CI. A CI covered by another company's
  contract reports false entitlement.

### Project commercial linkage — MCP-PROJ-001
- Neither `create_project` nor `update_project` exposed `contractID` or
  `opportunityID`, so a project could not be attached to the commercial record it
  bills against. Both are writable on Projects (verified live).
- Adds `autotask_link_project_commercial`: validates that contract and
  opportunity belong to the **same company as the project** (Autotask will
  happily point a project at another company's contract, silently misrouting its
  billing), that the contract is active and unexpired, skips a no-op re-link as
  `duplicate`, supports `dryRun`, and reads the link back field-by-field.
- Three fields `update_project` advertised are not writable Projects fields at
  all and were being forwarded to no effect: `estimatedTime` (read-only, rolled
  up from tasks) and `assignedResourceID`/`assignedResourceRoleID` (Task fields).
  They remain accepted as arguments so nothing breaks, are marked IGNORED in
  their descriptions, and are no longer sent upstream.
- The department field is `department`, not the advertised `departmentID`, so
  that value was silently dropped on every update. Both spellings now work.

### Tests (items 6-8)
- `tests/phase2-write-foundation.test.ts` — the envelope's no-write invariant, CI
  child-route creation, the read-only `companyID` refusal, unwritable-field
  stripping, both cross-company ownership guards, dry-run, duplicate detection,
  and `verified: false` when a write is accepted but not applied.
### Pagination — MCP-DEF-001 / MCP-CORE-001
- **`page` was accepted and discarded by 7 of the 9 search tools that advertised it.**
  Only `searchCompanies` and `searchTasks` honored it; every other search read
  `pageSize` into `maxRecords` and ignored `page`, so page 2 re-issued the same
  first-N query and returned page 1's records while reporting itself as page 2.
  Reported against `autotask_search_time_entries`; also affected tickets,
  contacts, projects, resources, billing items and approval levels. `page` is now
  also exposed on `search_service_calls` and `list_phases`, whose services gained
  paging here.
- Added `AutotaskService.paginate()` / `queryPaged()` — one implementation of the
  fetch-and-slice pattern Autotask's cursor-only API forces (no offset parameter),
  replacing the copy that existed in two methods and was missing from eight.
- Search methods now return `PagedResult<T>` (`items`, `page`, `pageSize`,
  `hasMore`) instead of a bare array, and the handler carries that metadata into
  the compact response. **`hasMore` is now honest:** it comes from over-fetching a
  single record past the window, not from `items.length >= pageSize`, which
  reported every exactly-full final page as "there is more".

### Service call date filtering — MCP-DEF-002 / MCP-CORE-002
- `autotask_search_service_calls` advertised `startAfter`/`startBefore`/`companyId`
  while the service only read `startDate`/`endDate`. Every filter was dropped and
  the query fell through to the MATCH_ALL sentinel — a request scoped to 2026
  returned service calls from 2007. Both bounds now constrain `startDateTime`
  (the old upper bound filtered `endDateTime`, dropping any call that started
  inside the window but ran past it); `startDate`/`endDate` remain as aliases.
- `searchResources` likewise dropped the advertised `isActive` and `resourceType`.

### Tool catalog parity — MCP-CORE-003
- 8 registered business tools were unreachable through category discovery:
  `update_contact`, `find_or_create_contact`, `update_project`,
  `get_invoice_details` and the four `ticket_checklist_item` tools. All are now
  categorized; the 5 remaining uncategorized tools are meta-tools (discovery,
  router, raw escape hatch) and are allowlisted as deliberate.

### Tests (items 1-5)
- `tests/phase2-pagination-contract.test.ts` — table-driven across all 10
  paginated searches: page advances, no duplicate ids across pages, the walk
  terminates, `pageSize` is respected, a full final page reports `hasMore: false`,
  and a page past the end is empty rather than a repeat of page 1. Plus an
  end-to-end check that the metadata survives into the tool response.
- `tests/phase2-date-filter-contract.test.ts` — asserts on the filter payload sent
  upstream, so a rename on either side of the schema/service boundary fails here
  instead of silently returning the whole table.
- `tests/phase2-tool-catalog-parity.test.ts` — registered tools == category union
  (minus the meta-tool allowlist), no phantom or duplicated entries. Closes the
  drift class that had gone unenforced for months.

## 2.19.0-gds — 2026-08-26 — First GDS production release

Cut over live on **the production host** (docker-compose, local build from this fork,
`/health` → `2.19.0-gds`), replacing the upstream `ghcr.io/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp`
pinned image. All items below verified against the code with mocked-HTTP unit
tests (316 passing at release).

### Route & payload correctness (Phase 1)
- **#2 (`fd69545`) — child-route creates + ticket role (§4.2–4.4).**
  `createContact` → `POST /Companies/{companyID}/Contacts` (companyID required);
  `createServiceCallTicket` → `POST /ServiceCalls/{id}/Tickets`;
  `createServiceCallTicketResource` → `POST /ServiceCallTickets/{id}/Resources`;
  restored `assignedResourceRoleID` to the ticket writable-field allowlist so
  typed assignment updates keep the role Autotask requires.

### HTTP layer
- **#3 (`bf78601`) — batched `in` query helper (§7.19).** `AutotaskHttpClient.queryByIds()`:
  dedupe + sort IDs → 200-per-chunk `in` queries under bounded concurrency →
  paginate each chunk → dedupe by id → surface per-chunk failures. (Cursor
  pagination §7.18 and 429/threshold handling §7.2 already existed in `query()`/`request()`.)

### Safety & resolution
- **#4 (`ad108a8`) — canonical reference resolver + protected-company guards (§7.30–7.31).**
  Read-only `autotask_resolve_record_reference` resolves a `T…` number to a
  single Ticket **or** Task (queries both, never infers from the prefix;
  matched/ambiguous/not-found). `utils/company-guard.ts`: `updateCompany` refuses
  to rename/reclassify/deactivate protected accounts (company `0` +
  `AUTOTASK_PROTECTED_COMPANY_IDS`); `createCompany` rejects non-company names
  (webmail/greeting/CTA/sentence).

### Response normalization
- **#5 (`3eabb99`) — one create-result contract (§5/§7.1).** Every create tool
  returns `{ id, entityType, parentType?, parentId? }` as `data`, normalized once
  centrally in `callTool` via `utils/create-result.ts` + `CREATE_TOOL_META`. (BREAKING:
  create `data` was a bare number → now `data.id`.)
- `c5cddf9` — follow-up: register `autotask_create_company_todo` in `CREATE_TOOL_META`.

### Calendar / executive-assistant objects (Phase 2)
- **#6 (`57618c4`) — CompanyToDos + router intent (§4.1/§4.10).** Six typed tools
  (get/search/create/update/complete/delete) via company child routes; actionType
  resolved from live picklist metadata (default "General"); `completedDate`
  completion; open-only search. Router matches a To-Do/follow-up intent before
  time-tracking so "sales follow-up To-Do" no longer misroutes to a time entry.

### Validation & tenant-aware resolution
- **#8 (`f65543e`) — owner / note limit / name search / opportunity update (§6.1–6.3, §4.7).**
  `createCompany` resolves `ownerResourceID` (supplied or
  `AUTOTASK_DEFAULT_OWNER_RESOURCE_ID`) and fails fast otherwise; contact `note`
  validated to 50 chars (opt-in `truncateNote`); contact search builds a combined
  firstName+lastName group + exact-email match; added `updateOpportunity` +
  `autotask_update_opportunity` via collection `PATCH /Opportunities`.

### Ticket & time completeness (Phase 3)
- **#9 (`355c50c`) — ticket-create fields, move-ticket, time-entry CRUD (§4.5/4.6/4.8).**
  Added `dueDateTime`/`companyLocationID`/`configurationItemID` to ticket create/update;
  `autotask_move_ticket_to_company` (resolves the target company's primary
  `CompanyLocations`, sets companyID+companyLocationID together, clears the
  contact unless supplied, refuses to move a CI-linked ticket unless forced,
  reads back); `autotask_get_time_entry` + `autotask_update_time_entry` (fractional
  hours, `hoursWorked` vs `hoursToBill`, `showOnInvoice`/`billingCodeID`).

### Build, dependency & release (Phase 5)
- **#7 (`7cdd90f`) — dependency source (deps).** Repointed dev-only `autotask-node`
  from the private `@wyre-technology` GitHub Packages alias to the public
  `github:GDSTechnology/autotask-node` fork (pinned), so `npm ci` needs no
  registry token.
- **#10 (`d088931`) — token-free Docker + release tooling (Phase 5).** Dockerfile
  drops the private-registry `.npmrc`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`; `scripts/build-image.sh`
  builds a traceable image (VERSION/COMMIT_SHA/BUILD_DATE → `/health`);
  `DEPLOY.md` deploy + rollback runbook for the production host.

### Housekeeping
- `fa5918f` — removed a stray `file:../autotask-node` link + lockfile churn that
  the initial Phase-1 PR (#1, `e476e5b`/`701c7df`) had bundled onto `main`.

---

### Notes
- **autotask-node** is a public GDS fork (`github:GDSTechnology/autotask-node`),
  dev-only — the runtime is a native-`fetch` client; the SDK is pruned from the
  production image.
- **Independent project:** this is a standalone GDS Technology project, originally
  derived from `WYRE-AI/autotask-mcp` (Apache-2.0) and now developed separately.
  The GitHub fork relationship and the `upstream` tracking remote have been
  removed; the codebases have diverged and are no longer reconciled.
